# 🎮 C Game Development Journey

## 🚀 Goal
Build complete **2D and 3D games in C** — from scratch, with no game engines.

---

## 🛤️ Roadmap

### 🧩 Phase 1 — Core Game Logic *(No Graphics)*
Learn the basics:
- Game loops
- Input handling
- Collisions
- Entity logic

> All done in the terminal or with debug output.

---

### 🎨 Phase 2 — 2D Graphics
Add visuals with lightweight libraries (e.g. SDL or Win32):
- Real-time rendering
- Sprite movement
- Frame timing & input

---

### 🧱 Phase 3 — 3D Fundamentals
Step into 3D:
- Camera and transforms
- Simple lighting and depth
- OpenGL or similar rendering

---

### 🌍 Phase 4 — Full 3D Game
Combine everything to build a complete **3D game in C**:
- Custom game loop
- Input, rendering, and camera
- Full control over gameplay and systems

---

> 🎓 *Start low-level. Learn everything. Build real games.*
