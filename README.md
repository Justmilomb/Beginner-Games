# 🌍 Build Your Own 3D Globe Engine in Python

## 🎯 Goal
Create a fully custom, interactive 3D globe engine in Python — from the ground up.

## 🛤️ Long-Term Pathway
**2D → 3D → Engine**

---

## 🧭 PHASE 1 — 2D Core Game Programming *(No UI Libraries Needed)*

**Objective:**  
Understand the core logic of games: input, game loops, collisions, entity logic, and systems.

### 🔧 Games You'll Build:
- **Dodge Game (Terminal-based)** – movement + falling enemies  
- **Snake (Grid Logic)** – real-time movement, body tracking  
- **Breakout / Arkanoid** – paddle + ball physics  
- **Top-down Shooter or Invaders** – simple projectiles, AI enemies  

> All logic is in the terminal or debug-print style — no graphics.  
> Focus on data structures, logic, and math.

## 🧭 PHASE 2 — 2D Graphics + Real-Time Systems

**Objective:**  
Move from text-based to rendered games, using a 2D framework (like `pygame`, but only when you're ready).

### 🎮 Convert and Expand:
- **Snake** → sprite grid version  
- **Breakout** → add ball physics + graphics  
- **Shooter** → bullets, enemies, sprites  
- **Mini RTS / Sim Game** → grid-based unit movement  

### 🧠 You'll Learn:
- Frame control  
- Rendering & timing  
- Input systems  
- Sprite layers & basic animation

## 🧭 PHASE 3 — 3D Concepts from 2D Games

**Objective:**  
Port your 2D games into basic 3D using your own logic or lightweight libraries like `moderngl`, `pyglet`, or `Panda3D`.

### 🔄 2D to 3D Conversions:
- **Shooter** → 3D top-down space shooter  
- **Snake** → 3D snake on a cube grid  
- **Breakout** → 3D paddle + ball with depth  

### 🧠 You'll Learn:
- 3D space & coordinate systems  
- Camera, transforms, and lighting basics  
- Simple shaders (if needed)

## 🧭 PHASE 4 — Build Your Own 3D Engine

**Objective:**  
Start building a **custom game engine** for rendering and interacting with a 3D world (your globe, countries, data, etc).

### 🧱 Features to Build:
- Scene manager (objects, camera, transforms)  
- Renderer (custom draw calls, shaders, textures)  
- Input system  
- Mouse picking or raycasting (e.g., select countries)  
- UI overlay (optional)  
- Data manager (country data, borders, etc.)

> This engine becomes the foundation of your 3D globe and simulation projects.

---

## 🧭 PHASE 5 — The Globe Engine

**Objective:**  
Design a **realistic, high-quality 3D globe** from scratch using Python and your own rendering systems.

### 🌐 Subsystems:
- Globe mesh (sphere) with normal/displacement maps  
- Country highlighting (shaders or geometry)  
- Mouse interaction (hover/select)  
- Lighting, rotation, zoom  
- Terrain/satellite texture streaming  
- Real-time updates (e.g., population, economy)

> This is the final evolution — a 3D, interactive, data-driven world you fully control.
